    <h2>It's more than just bathrooms.</h2
    <p>House Bill 2, which was signed into law in late March of this year, has been called "the most anti-LGBT law in the country" by critics. The bill is getting attention for its anti-trans "bathroom clause" which restricts bathroom occupancy based on the biological sex listed on a person's birth certificate. The bathrooom ordinance applies to multiple-occupancy restrooms and changing facilities in public schools, government agencies, and public colleges. But the law also goes far beyond restricting bathroom access. The state law overrides all local ordinances concerning minimum wage rates, employment policies and public accomodations. The only state with a law as severe on the books is Mississippi.</p>
  </br>
    <p>Just weeks after the bill passed, over 130 companies spoke out against it. Paypal pulled 400 jobs and cancelled plans for a Charlotte facility in response to the law. The NBA is considering moving the All-Star Game, which was supposed to take place in Charlotte next year. Many artists, most recently Demi Lovato and Nick Jonas, have canceled appearances in North Carolina. Some State and local governments have restricted government-funded travel to the state. North Carolina could lose $4.5 billion of federal funding if the law is found to be in conflict with Title IX. House Bill 2 has already been challenged legally by the ACLU and Equality NC, with plaintiffs ranging from a high school student to a university employee.
